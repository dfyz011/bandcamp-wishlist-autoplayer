## 📤 How to Build a ZIP for Publishing

1. Make sure all necessary files are present in the project folder:

   - `manifest.json`
   - popup and content files
   - icons

2. Compress the **contents** of the folder (not the folder itself) into a ZIP archive:

**On Mac/Linux:**

```bash
cd bandcamp-wishlist-autoplayer
zip -r bandcamp-extension.zip . -x "*.git*" "*.DS_Store"
```

**On Windows:**

- Select all files inside the folder → Right-click → "Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder"

3. Go to [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chromewebstore.google.com/) and upload the `.zip`

## 💡 Future Ideas

- Bandcamp just hide htmls when switch between tabs, so list of tracks is wrong
- Track progress bar
- Link to track
- Link to album
- Add support for album queue
- Dark theme support for popup
